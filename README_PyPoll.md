Overview
The PyPoll project is a Python script designed to modernize vote-counting for a small, rural town. The script analyzes poll data from election_data.csv to calculate election statistics, including total votes, candidates' vote percentages, total votes per candidate, and determining the election winner.

Data Source
The data used for this analysis comes from the election_data.csv file. The dataset consists of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. These records represent individual votes cast in an election.

Total number of votes cast.
Complete list of candidates who received votes.
Percentage of votes each candidate won.
Total number of votes each candidate received.
Winner of the election based on popular vote.

Code Explanation
The script processes the election_data.csv file to calculate and output the following metrics:

Total Votes: Counts the total number of votes cast in the election.
List of Candidates: Identifies all unique candidates who received votes.
Vote Percentages: Calculates the percentage of the total votes that each candidate won.
Vote Counts: Summarizes the total number of votes each candidate received.

Conclusion
The PyPoll project provides an efficient and automated solution for analyzing election data, determining candidate standings, and identifying the election winner.
